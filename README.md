Scripts and code for running simulations likely require modification to suit your computational environment.

Many scripts have dependencies including:

JSONLab: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files

Additional information should be listed in file headers.

Be sure to add ./functions/ directory to your MATLAB path.

Simulations require the NEURON simulation environment (Hines and Carnevale, 1997): https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download

Simulations were conducted on the Orchestra High Performance Compute Cluster at Harvard Medical School. This NIH supported shared facility consists of thousands of processing cores and terabytes of associated storage and is partially provided through grant NCRR 1S10RR028832-01. See http://rc.hms.harvard.edu for more information.

Scripts work on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5520 workstation with 16 cores and 72 GB RAM, running Ubuntu 12.04 x64 and MATLAB (R) R2015a (8.5.0.197613) 64-bit (glnxa64).
